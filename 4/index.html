            <p>What a great place to put our love for all things kittens. Love them or hate them, it doesn't matter because this is just a part of your HTML learning project today.</p>

            <div class="container">

              <div class="row">
                  <div class="col-sm">

                <p class="text-center">Kittens are small cuddly poop machines who play all night and sleep all day. They have nails like razors and noses that are wet and cold.They prey upon our sensibilities and often end up lounging around on our laptops because they are warm. Also because we usually are stuck in front of a deadline and must use them. </p>

                  </div>

                  <div class="col-sm">

                <img class="fluid" src="http://placekitten.com/250/250">

                <p class="text-justify">After kittens grow up they become jerky roomates who we love. Does it matter that they won't do the dishes, pay rent, or take out the trash? No! Why should they when we are here to do that for them. In fact, who <strong>really</strong> is the pet and who is the master? Maybe the Ancient Egyptions got it right. They worshipped cats. <em>And also dung beetles. </em><cite><a href="https://www.quotes.net/mquote/41323">With Thanks to Ron Weasley</a></cite></p>

                <p class="blockquote">&ldquo;May 4, 1985. I am packing for a short trip to New York to discuss the cat book with Brion. In the front room where the kittens are kept, Calico Jane is nursing one black kitten. I pick up my Tourister. It seems heavy. I look inside and there are her other four kittens...Take care of my babies. Take them with you wherever you go.&rdquo; <cite>William S. Burroughs, <a href ="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Cat_Inside">The Cat Inside</a></cite></p>


                <p class="text-lowercase small">What a lovely quote. <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/William_S._Burroughs">William Burroughs</a> used to live in <a href="https://goo.gl/maps/uBqCkWXBtbL2">Lawrence, Kansas.</a> Every autumn, Freshmen (and Women) students from <a href="https://ku.edu/">Kansas University students</a> would spend too much time at the bar and then try in vain to find his house to get his autograph. </p>

            <p>I would have thought he would have found that annoying in his old age. William Burroughs lived to the ripe age of 83 and <a href ="https://www.johnnytimes.com/william-s-burroughs-and-cat">is thought to have loved cats his entire life.</a></p>

            <p> Ernest Hemingway also was a lover of cats and kittens. He now has a specific type of cat named after him and his cats he used to take care of. They are called Hemingway Cats. Do you know why? Because they have six toes. These are also called polydactyl cats and sailors believed they were good luck. Their extra toes made them better mousers and helped them balance on the high seas. Many of his cats still live in his house in Key West and it is believed that the cats in Key West are all related to each other because of this. I got this information from this <a href = "https://www.wideopenpets.com/story-ernest-hemingway-six-toed-cats/">website,</a> so we to link to it so people can see where we got this great nugget of information! Yay for six toed cats!</p>

            <p>So lets have a celebration of kittens by using a free online placeholder site called <a href="http://placekitten.com/">Placekitten.com</a> </p>

            <p>I am quite aware that some people don't like kittens. <strong>That is completely fine.</strong> For those of you who don't like cats, I guess I'll allow some pictures of Bill Murray from <a href="http://www.fillmurray.com/">this placeholder site called Fill Murray</a></p>
